                Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
                Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
                Like to the lark at break of day arising
                From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate;
                For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
                That then I scorn to change my state with kings

                Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
                Dreaming about the things that we could be
                But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
                Said, "No more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars"
                Yeah, we'll be counting stars
                I see this life, like a swinging vine
                Swing my heart across the line
                And in my face is flashing signs
                Seek it out and ye shall find
                Old, but I'm not that old
                Young, but I'm not that bold
                And I don't think the world is sold
                On just doing what we're told
                I feel something so right
                Doing the wrong thing
                And I feel something so wrong
                Doing the right thing
                I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
                Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

            I wandered lonely as a cloud
            That floats on high vales and hills,
            When all at once I saw a crowd,
            A host, of golden daffodils;
            Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
            Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

                I feel your love, and I feel it burn
                Down this river, every turn
                Hope is our four-letter word
                Make that money, watch it burn
                Old, but I'm not that old
                Young, but I'm not that bold
                And I don't think the world is sold

                Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
                Take that money, watch it burn
                Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
                Take that money, watch it burn
                Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
                Take that money, watch it burn
                Sink in the river the lessons I've learned

                Two hearts, one valve
                Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
                We were the body and
                Two lives, one life
                Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
                Makin' it right
                Seasons, they will change
                Life will make you grow
                Dreams will make you cry, cry, cry
                Everything is temporary
                Everything will slide
                Love will never die, die, die
                I know that, ooh, birds fly in different directions
                Ooh, I hope to see you again
                Sunsets, sunrises
                Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
                Changin' the seasons
                Some nights I think of you
                Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
                Wishin' and dreamin'

                Everything is temporary
                Everything will slide
                Love will never die, die, die

                Ooh, birds fly in different direction
                Ooh, so fly high, so fly high
                When the moon is lookin' down
                Shinin' light upon your ground
                I'm flyin' up to let you see
                That the shadow cast is me
                I know that, ooh, birds fly in different directions
                Ooh, I hope to see you again
                Ooh, birds fly in different directions
